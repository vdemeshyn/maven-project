I've implemented this auto test using Cucumber - advanced frame for automation.
The only problem I've faced - cucumber creates methods with 'void' parameter, so I could not use constructions to return any values and use in another methods.
That's why I had to implement all next steps in new window with new session.
However, code can be easily imported to TestNG projects.
Waiting for your review.
